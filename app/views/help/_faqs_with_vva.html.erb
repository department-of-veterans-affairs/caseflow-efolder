  <h2 id="what-is-efolder-express">1. What is eFolder Express?</h2>

  <p>
    eFolder Express is a web-based application which allows authorized VA employees to bulk-download documents from a veteran's VBMS efolder, reducing the need to manually click and save these documents one by one. It was built by the Digital Service at VA (DSVA) and will create cost savings and process improvement for many areas of the VA such as the Office of General Council and the Records Management Center.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-does-efolder-express-do">2. How was eFolder Express developed? Who was involved?</h2>

  <p>
    The Digital Service team worked closely with stakeholders across the VA to develop and test this software over the last several months. Using feedback from VA employees and human-centered design principles, we've tweaked and improved the tool steadily. We will continue to improve the tool  based on feedback and as we have more opportunities to make things simpler.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-to-access">3. How do I get access to eFolder Express?</h2>

  <p>
    Due to PII and PHI considerations, eFolder Express is only accessible to authorized VA
    employees. To get access to eFolder Express, you must submit a request to your Information
    Security Officer (ISO) and/or Information Resources Management (IRM) team to adjust your
    Common Security Employee Manager (CSEM) permissions. To initiate the request, draft an
    email requesting your current permissions be updated as follows:

     <p class="cf-help-image-wrapper">
      <%= image_tag 'help/efolder-access.png', {class: "cf-help-image", alt: 'eFolder Access'} %>
     </p>

    Once the email is drafted, attach a copy of your latest “VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rues of Behavior” training certificate and forward the email to your supervisor for approval. If approved, your supervisor should forward the request to your station’s IRM team and/or ISO for entry into CSEM. You will receive an email notice once access is granted.
  </p>

  <h2 id="browser-compatibility">4. Which browser can I use with eFolder Express? </h2>
   <p>
    eFolder Express is compatible with most modern browsers, such as Internet Explorer 9 (or later), Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
   </p>
   
  <h2 id="view-efolder">5. After searching for a case, I received the message "You don't have permission to view this efolder." What does this mean?</h2>

  <p>
    This message is usually received when the requested efolder contains sensitive information or when you don't have the privileges required to access it.
  </p>

  <h2 id="virtual-va">6. Does eFolder Express downloads include Virtual VA documents?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, eFolder Express downloads include both VBMS and Virtual VA documents. Virtual VA documents from the Legacy Content Manager (LCM) tab in VBMS are automatically included when an efolder is downloaded using eFolder Express.
  </p>

  <h2 id="permission-error">6. After searching for a case, I received the message "You don't have permission to view this eFolder." What does this mean?</h2>

  <p>
    This usually happens when the eFolder contains sensitive information or when you don't have the privileges required to access it.
  </p>

  <h2 id="efolder-legacy">7. Does eFolder Express downloads include Legacy Content Manager documents?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, eFolder Express downloads include VBMS documents and Virtual VA documents from the Legacy Content Manager (LCM) tab.
  </p>

  <h2 id="start-retrieving">8. What happens when I click "Start Retrieving eFolder"?</h2>

  <p>
    eFolder Express begins gathering documents from the VBMS database as well as Virtual VA documents stored in the Legacy Content Manager . At this point, you can return to the eFolder Express home page to search for another Veteran ID. eFolder Express is able to retrieve multiple efolders at the same time. You can also close the browser window while the retrieval is in progress and eFolder Express will continue gathering the efolder documents in the background. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to retrieve all the files from an efolder (depending on its size). Remember, you can return to the retrieval page from the History list on the eFolder Express home page by clicking the View Results link. Keep in mind, to actually open the efolder documents, you will need to download the efolder to your computer after the retrieval process completes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="retrieval-order">9. In what order does eFolder Express retrieve files from VBMS?</h2>
  <p>
    eFolder Express retrieves files in order of date received.
  </p>

  <h2 id="cancel-retrieval">10. Can I cancel the file retrieval process after it starts?</h2>
   
  <p>
    No. Once eFolder Express begins retrieving an efolder from VBMS and the Legacy Content Manager, you cannot cancel the retrieval. You can, however, choose not to download the efolder to your computer after it is retrieved.
  </p>

  <h2 id="selecting-documents">11. What if I only need to download specific documents from an eFolder? Can I select the documents I want to download?</h2>

  <p>
    Currently, eFolder Express only supports downloading an entire efolder. If you need to download a specific document, or set of documents, from a veteran's efolder, you can either download the entire efolder using eFolder Express and delete the documents you do not need, or you can download the specific document, or set of documents, manually from VBMS and from the Legacy Content Manager (for Virtual VA documents)
  </p>

  <h2 id="errors-retrieving">12. Why am I getting errors while trying to retrieve documents from an efolder?</h2>

  <p>
    If you are receiving errors while trying to retrieve documents from an efolder, it may be because VBMS is  down. Since eFolder Express pulls information directly from the VBMS database, if VBMS is not running correctly, eFolder Express will not be able to connect to VBMS to retrieve the efolder. You can retry the entire efolder retrieval when VBMS is running again. You may also encounter errors if your internet connection cuts out temporarily. Again, you can retry retrieving the entire efolder again. In rare cases, there may be a problem with a document in VBMS. If this happens, you may need to download that specific document manually from VBMS.
  </p>

  <h2 id="download-efolder">13. What happens when I click "Download eFolder"?</h2>

  <p>
    Your browser will ask you to open the folder or to designate a folder where you would like to save the efolder. Due to PII/PHI sensitivity considerations, VA requires you to download the efolder files to a shared drive, rather than your local disk. The retrieved efolder will then be downloaded as a .ZIP file onto the shared drive in the following pattern; lastnamefirstname-lastfourdigitsoftheveteransid.zip (for example: doejohn-1234.zip). After you open the .ZIP file, you will see the list of downloaded documents in receipt date order. They will be located inside a folder labeled in the same manner as the .zip file
  </p>

  <h2 id="name-downloaded-efolder">14. How does eFolder Express name the downloaded efolder documents?</h2>

  <p>
    Individual documents within an efolder will be prefixed with a number but, otherwise, retain their VBMS document type name. Documents will be listed in receipt date order and will be saved in the following pattern; documentnumber-documenttype-receiptdate-documentID.zip, where the date is written 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day (for example: 0010-HearingRequest_2016018.zip).
  </p>

  <h2 id="history">15. What is History? How long does an efolder remain in my History?</h2>

  <p>
    The History section on the eFolder Express home page shows a record of efolders that you have recently retrieved, as well as efolders the application is currently retrieving from VBMS and the Legacy Content Manager. You will see a "View Results" link next to efolders that have been retrieved from VBMS and the Legacy Content Manager and are ready to download, and a "View Progress" link next to efolders currently being retrieved. If any errors occurred during the retrieval process, you will see a red warning icon next to documents with errors. The History list clears automatically after 3 days.
  </p>

  <h2 id="telecommuting">16. Does eFolder Express work while telecommuting?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, you can use eFolder Express while connected to the VA network via VPN.
  </p>

  <h2 id="encounter-problems">17. What should I do if I encounter problems?</h2>

  <p>
    If you encounter any problems while using eFolder Express, you should ask your supervisor for assistance. If you and your supervisor are unable to resolve the issue, please reach out to the Caseflow Product Support Team by calling 1-844-876-5548 or emailing caseflow@va.gov.
  </p>

  <h2 id="share-feedback">18. How do I share my feedback for improving eFolder Express?</h2>

  <p>
    You can use the "Send feedback" link located on the bottom right side of any eFolder Express page or in the dropdown menu next to your username to share your ideas for improving eFolder Express.
  </p>

  <h2 id="need-help">19. What if I still need help?</h2>

  <p>
    If you still encounter issues or have questions that are not answered here, reach out to the Caseflow Product Support Team by calling 1-844-876-5548 or emailing caseflow@va.gov.
